Team,

Everyone must be in full uniform while on the clock. Jeans are NOT apart of your uniform, you must wear all black work slacks and all black non-slip shoes. Your Polo must be tucked in at all times with your name tag, if you wear a undershirt it must be either black or white.If you are going to wear a jacket it must be a Santikos jacket or a all black jacket, your name tag must still be visible.

If you are in concessions or Cafe you must have your hair in a hat or a hair net, If your hair is longer then shoulder length it must be in a bun or a braided ponytail. If you are on floor your hair must still be in a ponytail.

Facial jewelry can not be worn while on the clock, earrings can not dangle or be larger then a quarter.

All of the uniform guidelines can be found in your employee handbook. This change starts now, we will give you guys until March 9th to make all the necessary changes. After the 9th if you do not come in full uniform you will be sent home or given a PIP.
